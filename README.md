## 👋 Hi, I’m @thomas2crypto — or *crowes*.

### 👀 What I’m doing
I drift between projects like a packet on a busy network:  
Sometimes I’m deep into a larger Arduino build, other times I’m poking around in Metasploit just to see what still works. I jump between topics a lot — controlled chaos, but it keeps me learning.

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
I’m not a master of everything, but I understand tech fast and reliably:  
- General networking knowledge  
- Solid technical intuition across systems  
- Basics in C++ (and therefore minimal C)  
- Bash  
- Understanding Python concepts (but not writing it… yet)  
- Tools like **msf**, **Nmap**, and whatever else looks interesting that day

### 🔬 How I work
I experiment constantly — sometimes with a plan, sometimes with pure curiosity.  
But when something clicks and progress comes fast, I lock in hard. In those moments, I can crank out thousands of lines of code a day… assuming I actually know the language well enough to do it.

### 🧭 Motto
**“Build stuff, break stuff, repair.  
And again, and again, and again.”**  
(Yes, it’s a loop. No, I’m not escaping it.)
